## Git and GitHub

This course was helpful and reminded about the basic things in Git. It's always a good idea to come back to basics from time to time:)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really enjoyed this task and will use terminal now more often, because before I used only 1 command "git clone"))

### What was new to me

- most of the commands were new, especially those with redirection

### What surprised me

-  the redirect part and the part with configuring the environment really impressed me. Had no idea before that it is possible to do!

### What I intend to use in future

- navigation - for sure!

## Git Collaboration

### What was new to me

- I finally understood the difference between git pull and git fetch. It was super useful
- using 'wider' versions of git log, like git log --author
- squashing commits using git rebase

### What I intend to use in future

- I will definitely use all git commands that I use now + in a while will try to use git rebase, cause I think it's quite a good one.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

### What was new to me

- tags like \<sub\> and \<sup\>, \<del\> and \<ins\>

### What I intend to use in future

Basically everything regarding HTML&CSS except for tables(not sure if it is still being used :sweat_smile:)

## Responsive Web Design

### What was new to me

- making tables responsive

### What surprised me

- the ability to use different 2 breakpoints to make some changes between it (why didn't I think about it before :neutral_face:)

### What I intend to use in future

Everything, because it's basics for making website responsive

## JS Basics

### What was new to me

Almost nothing, but still it was useful to practice some array methods like forEach, reduce etc. Have never used it before in practice.

### What surprised me

Quizes, they were really cool. Some of them too easy, but tricky and it was interesting to solve. Also tasks on FreeCodeCamp, these are high level (as it seemd to me), but exteremely useful and practical.

### What I intend to use in future

Everythiiing
