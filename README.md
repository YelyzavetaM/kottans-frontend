# kottans-frontend

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really enjoyed this task and will use terminal now more often, because earlier I used only 1 command "git clone"))

What was new to me

- most of the commands were new, especially redirection

What surprised me

-  the redirect part and the part with configuring the environment really impressed. Had no idea before that it is possible to do!

What I intend to use in future

- navigation - for sure!
