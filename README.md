# kottans-frontend

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really enjoyed this task and will use terminal now more often, because earlier I used only 1 command "git clone")) now I have an understanding of how to navigate between directories and files and so on. Also I was a bit impressed in a good way by the redirect part and about the part with configuring the environment. Had no idea before that it is possible to do!
