## Git and GitHub

This course was helpful and reminded about the basic things in Git. It's always a good idea to come back to basics from time to time:)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really enjoyed this task and will use terminal now more often, because before I used only 1 command "git clone"))

### What was new to me

- most of the commands were new, especially redirection

### What surprised me

-  the redirect part and the part with configuring the environment really impressed. Had no idea before that it is possible to do!

### What I intend to use in future

- navigation - for sure!
