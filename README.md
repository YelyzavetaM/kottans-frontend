## Git and GitHub

This course was helpful and reminded about the basic things in Git. It's always a good idea to come back to basics from time to time:)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really enjoyed this task and will use terminal now more often, because before I used only 1 command "git clone"))

### What was new to me

- most of the commands were new, especially those with redirection

### What surprised me

-  the redirect part and the part with configuring the environment really impressed me. Had no idea before that it is possible to do!

### What I intend to use in future

- navigation - for sure!

## Git Collaboration

### What was new to me

- I finally understood the difference between git pull and git fetch. It was super useful
- using 'wider' versions of git log, like git log --author
- squashing commits using git rebase

### What I intend to use in future

- I will definitely use all git commands that I use now + in a while will try to use git rebase, cause I think it's quite a good one. 


## JS Basics
